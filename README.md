## Getting Started
First, install dependencies. You'll need Node and NPM - instructions for installing those can be found at [Treehouse Installation Guides](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/). In your terminal, cd to the root folder and install node modules by running `npm install`. You'll also need to install NPX globally by running `npm i -g npx`.

## Development server

Run `npx -p @angular/cli ng serve` for a dev server. In a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
